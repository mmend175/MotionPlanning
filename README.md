<b>#Quadrotor Motition Planning Waypoint Navigation </b> 
Motion/Trajectory planner simulation using Rapid Exploring Random Trees with A-star cost function for multiple obstacle avoidance. The quadrotors constraints are based a Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor platform. Minimum Jerk technique with spline polynomials with linear dynamics was implemented.
